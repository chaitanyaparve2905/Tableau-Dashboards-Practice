# 📊 Superstore Performance Dashboard (Tableau)
## 🧩 Project Overview
This Tableau project, Superstore Performance Dashboard, presents an interactive visual analysis of a fictional retail chain's performance across three main product categories: Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies. Using sales, profit, and geographic data, the dashboard enables users to:

- Track time-series trends at the sub-category level.

- Compare performance across regions and product types.

- Detect low-performing segments using negative profit visuals.

- Easily switch metrics between Sales and Profit for deep analysis.

The dashboard is built on the classic Sample Superstore dataset and is ideal for business users, analysts, and executives seeking performance insights at a glance.
